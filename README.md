# 100 Days CSS Challenge Submission

I created new folder for every submission with day[000 - 100] naming format.
Every submission mainly has dedicated README file contained:
1. What I Learn. I will write new concepts (and hard concepts, at least for me) of CSS from each submission.
2. Further Explorations. I will put some links to deep dive some CSS concepts and properties i learned from each sumbission, mainly from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/).
